# Partitioning Performance in SQL

## Introduction
Partitioning is a database design technique used to improve performance, manageability, and availability. It involves dividing a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions. Each partition can be managed and accessed independently, which can lead to significant performance improvements for certain types of queries.

In this article, we will explore the concept of partitioning in SQL databases and discuss its impact on performance. We will cover the benefits of partitioning, common partitioning strategies, and best practices for implementing partitioning in your database.
